## What is C#?
C# is a modern programming language developed by Microsoft. It was originally intended to be used in Windows program development. C# builds upon C and C++(Â´s Syntax? or compilator?) and also Java. C# is also created in a way to be programmed object oriented. This makes it easier for multiple programmers to work with, because [[OOP]] (**O**bject **O**riented **P**rogramming) is integrated into C#.

## C# characteristics
* C# is a *strongly typed* language.
* Resilient to *logical errors/bugs* thanks to its strongly typed nature.
* *Versitile*, thanks to .[[NET]] Core, recently renamed .[[NET]]. 
* *Built-in memory handling*.
* *Popular*, thanks to these characteristics. Especially with companies that work on long-term projects as well as projects handling big amounts of data (because of the resilient to errors and bugs).
