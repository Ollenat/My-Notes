### Normal force: 
If you stand on the ground, you are constantly pushing down on the ground due to gravity. However, you are not falling through the ground, why? 

Because of normal force. Normal force is the corresponding force an object recieves when trying to pass through a solid surface. 

This means that the force will be as big as the force pushing on the surface, but inverted. It is always in the direction of a normal (perpendicular) to the surface as well. There are forces parallel to the surfaces, typically called [[Frictional forces]]. 

This force is often represented as `N` or `Fn`.
