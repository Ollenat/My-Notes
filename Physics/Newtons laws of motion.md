### Newtons first law of motion: Inertia
**Olle's explanation:** If the result of all forces affecting this object is zero, the object either travels along a straigh line in space, with constant velocity. Or the object is in rest, staying still, not moving.

**Fancy Alternative:** "Every object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless compelled to change its state by the action of an external force. This tendency to resist changes in the state of motion is inertia." (NASA)



### Newtons second law of motion: Acceleration
States that `F = m * a`  where:
* `F` is the *force*
* `m` is the *mass*
* `a` is the *acceleration* 

Useful for calculating the gravitational force using the gravitational acceleration (`g`). 
*Ex:* A book weighs 500g and is placed on a table. With what force is the book pushing down on the table?

500g = 0.5kg
`F = m * a` 
`F = 0.5 * g`
`F = 0.5 * 9.82`
~ `F = 5N`



### Newtons third law of motion: Action & Reaction
Whenever one object exerts a force on a second object, the second objects exerts an equal and opposite force on the first. (NASA)

Meaning, if you kick a football with 50N you foot will recieve the same amount of force as the ball, 50N.
