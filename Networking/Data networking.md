## What is data networking?
Data networking is about transferring information. It is a system of hardware, software, and protocols used to move information from one device from another. For instance, a web page from a server to a client, the browser. 
When the data is transferred, it is encapsulated, encoded and then sent over multiple different networks with different encodings. And this is needs to happen without any loss of information. 

## OSI Model - Open Systems Interconnect
- A model made in the 70s in order to describe network operations
- Gave us a place to categorize protocols (operations?)
- Gave us an order these protocols is processed in
