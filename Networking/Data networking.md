## What is data networking?
Data networking is about transferring information. It is a system of hardware, software, and protocols used to move information from one device from another. For instance, a web page from a server to a client, the browser. 
When the data is transferred, it is encapsulated, encoded and then sent over multiple different networks with different encodings. And this is needs to happen without any loss of information. 

## OSI Model - Open Systems Interconnection Model
- A model made in the 70s in order to describe network operations
- Gave us a place to categorize protocols and network communication
- Gave us an order these protocols is processed in

#### What it looks like
The OSI model consists of 7 tables.  
7. **Application layer** - This is the layer where [[application protocols]] are used. Programs can use these protocols to e.g., transfer files with the FTP (File Transfer Protocol), get websites with the HTTP or HTTPs (Hypertext Transfer Protocol (secure)). In this layer is also [[DNS]] [[WIP]] 
6. **Presentation layer** -
